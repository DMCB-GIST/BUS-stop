The code simultaneously generates the results for all the stop-criteria presented in the paper.
The results are dumped to several files in a log folder.
We can check the results by reading the dump files after running the codes. 
The quick results (in SST-2) can be reproduced by repro_results.py.
This code is made for analysis purposes.
** We plan to upload the easy version of this code after publication, at https://github.com/DMCB-GIST/BUS-stop. **

The results of Table 2 can be generated by running the 'run_bal.py'
  Eg) python run_bal.py --gpu 0 --data SST-2 --k 50 --valid_k 25 --epochs 30 

The result of Figure 3 can be generated by running the 'run_k_bal.py'
  Eg) python run_k_bal.py --gpu 0 --data IMDB --k 100 --valid 0.25 

The results of Table 4 and 5 can be generated by running the 'run_imbal.py'
  Eg) python run_imbal.py --gpu 0 --data SST-2 --K 100 --trn_neg 0.5 --tst_neg 0.2 
  (In this code, run_imbal.py, the 'K' means the number of all the labeled samples, not per class.)
