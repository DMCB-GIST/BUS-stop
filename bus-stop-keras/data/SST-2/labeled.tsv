0	more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
0	this new zealand coming-of-age movie is n't really about anything .
0	rock 's stand-up magic wanes .
0	hollywood ending just is n't very funny .
0	like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .
0	the only pain you 'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub .
0	unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .
0	what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -lrb- dark green , to be exact -rrb- , sour , bloody and mean .
0	suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
0	no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
0	the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
0	the plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
0	a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties .
0	a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
0	a sentimental mess that never rings true .
0	schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness .
0	but i had a lot of problems with this movie .
0	a humorless journey into a philosophical void .
0	-lrb- toback 's -rrb- fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard ... blends uneasily with the titillating material .
0	a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc .
0	i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
0	due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter .
0	the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
0	plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
0	tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .
0	moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .
0	a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .
0	when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
0	you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
0	somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .
0	the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .
0	sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .
0	... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .
0	even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
0	never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .
0	stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
0	the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada .
0	lurid and less than lucid work .
0	yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .
0	kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -lrb- or worth rooting against , for that matter -rrb- .
0	another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
0	britney spears ' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .
0	this u-boat does n't have a captain .
0	they threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
0	originality is sorely lacking .
0	the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...
0	the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
0	supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
0	while some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .
0	as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .
1	brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day .
1	it 's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill .
1	director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo .
1	it 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .
1	like the best of godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable .
1	tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme does n't drag an audience down .
1	old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment .

1	an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing .
1	visually striking and viscerally repellent .
1	the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting .
1	a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man 's dying fall .
1	what bubbles up out of john c. walsh 's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch .
1	a witty , low-key romantic comedy .
1	that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle .
1	though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .

1	it can be safely recommended as a video\/dvd babysitter .
1	with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work .
1	seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil .
1	it 's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments .
1	until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films .
1	about the best thing you could say about narc is that it 's a rock-solid little genre picture .
1	keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s.c. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner .
1	very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both .
1	piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling .
1	as a science fiction movie , `` minority report '' astounds .
1	between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season .

1	the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .
1	the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard .
1	a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot .
1	what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride .
1	-lrb- a -rrb- thoughtful , visually graceful work .
1	succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides .

1	the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes .
