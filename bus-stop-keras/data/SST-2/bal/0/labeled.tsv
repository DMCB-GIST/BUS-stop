0	a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .
0	as saccharine as it is disposable .
0	deserving of its critical backlash and more .
0	its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess .
0	will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
0	the movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
0	no better or worse than ` truth or consequences , n.m. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater .
0	derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
0	the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
0	the movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity .
0	yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
0	i think it was plato who said , ' i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
0	the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .
0	a semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
0	that the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor .
0	fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .
0	a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
0	this pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
0	a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
0	cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
0	i 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
0	an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
0	there 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .
0	... a pretentious mess ...
0	the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .
0	it looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
0	the story the movie tells is of brian de palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
0	plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
0	spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units .
0	an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
0	a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .
0	the film 's most improbable feat ?
0	jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
0	there is nothing redeeming about this movie .
0	for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
0	with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .
0	a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy french grandfather .
0	it all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer .
0	even with its $ 50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .
0	lookin ' for sin , american-style ?
0	stale , futile scenario .
0	becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .
0	a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .
0	fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
0	and diesel is n't the actor to save it .
0	be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .
0	while easier to sit through than most of jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .
0	the entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
0	-lrb- the film 's -rrb- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers .
0	illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .
1	crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half .
1	a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man .
1	i 've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close .

1	an enjoyable above average summer diversion .
1	allen 's funniest and most likeable movie in years .
1	a generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith .
1	it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing
1	an elegant and sly deadpan comedy .
1	this is n't a stand up and cheer flick ; it 's a sit down and ponder affair .
1	a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
1	too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper -lrb- and better -rrb- than pink floyd tickets .
1	superb production values & christian bale 's charisma make up for a derivative plot .
1	like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea 's recent past and south korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight .
1	the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable .
1	for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera .
1	works , it 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance .
1	an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation .
1	best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .
1	in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
1	reminiscent of alfred hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen .
1	there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front .
1	mr. spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned .
1	a lovably old-school hollywood confection .
1	with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids .
1	engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .
1	mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest the mummy returns .

1	does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets .
1	pete 's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish .
1	a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage `` be careful what you wish for '' is given a full workout .
1	this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it 's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men .
1	light-years ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least artistically .
1	michael moore 's latest documentary about america 's thirst for violence is his best film yet ...
1	i 'm guessing the director is a magician .

1	a smart , compelling drama .
1	there 's a part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something .

1	a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional .
1	even if you 're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor .
1	a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe .
1	to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest .
1	garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you 'll want things to work out .
1	a compelling film .
1	if you 're part of her targeted audience , you 'll cheer .
