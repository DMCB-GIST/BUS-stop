0	these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .
0	bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .
0	wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own .

0	director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading .
0	with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -lrb- crane -rrb- becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .

0	what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
0	a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .

0	brosnan 's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
0	these characters become wearisome .
0	some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
0	the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
0	as steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .

0	the most horrific movie experience i 've had since `` ca n't stop the music . ''
0	staggeringly dreadful romance .
0	ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway
0	the author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
