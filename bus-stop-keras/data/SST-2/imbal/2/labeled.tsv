0	... unlike -lrb- scorsese 's mean streets -rrb- , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
0	... blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
0	there 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .
0	the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
0	this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .
0	they just do n't work in concert .
0	instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .

0	may puzzle his most ardent fans .
0	like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .
0	a supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .
0	while it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
0	the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .
0	there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
0	a sentimental mess that never rings true .
0	been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional .

0	chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
0	... built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids .
0	its generic villains lack any intrigue -lrb- other than their funny accents -rrb- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
0	-lrb- seagal 's -rrb- strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's razzie .
